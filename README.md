# PitchPerfect-iOS

- Description: It is a fun iOS application that I have made which transforms the voice recorded by the user to various characters like chipmunk, Darth Vader etc by changing the recorder voice's pitch and rate.

- Frameworks used:
  - UIKit
  - AVFoundation

- Detailed description: 
  - In this app we have added various functionalities like we are moving between the view controllers with the help of NAVIGATION CONTROLLER. 
  - And also we are using the AVFoundation framework to basically work with the sounds like:
    - Recording the sounds.
    - Passing sound from one view controller to other etc.
  - In this application we have also used AUTOLAYOUT CONSTRAINTS in order to ensure that our app works fine on all screen sizes.
